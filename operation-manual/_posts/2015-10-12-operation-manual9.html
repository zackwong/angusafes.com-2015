<p><span style="font-size: 14px">OPENNING THE LOCK-Use the OPENNING index</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px">Always turn the dial slowly and carefully. If you turn past a number in the combination while dialing, DO NOT turn the dial backwards. You must re-dial the entire combination. The lock comes with a factory-set combination on 50, turn the dial to the LEFT (countercolckwise) four complete turns stopping with 50 lined-up on the OPENNING index on the fourth turn. Turn RIGHT until the dial stops. The combination lock bolt will retract and the safe may be oppened.</span></p>  
<p><span style="font-size: 14px">NOTE: if you dial past the number where you were supposed to stop, you can not  reverse the dial to correct. The opening procedure must be repeated from the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px">To open a lock with a SET three number combination, for example, 11-36-22,use the following procedures:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px">1. Turn the dial to the LEFT(counterclockwise) at least four complete rotations to clear the lock to accept the combination. Never spin the dial to clear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px">2. Using the OPENING index, turn the dial LEFT and pass the first nmber of the combination 11, three times and stop exactly on 11 the fourth time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px">3. Turn the dial to the RIGHT(clockwise) and pass 36 two times and stop exactly on 36 the third time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px">4. Turn the dial LEFT and pass 22 once and stop exactly on 22 the second time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px">5. Turn the dial to the RIGHT when the lock is open, the dial will stop between 90 and 0.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px">To lock the combination lock, turn the dial four complete rotations to the LEFT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px">CHANGING THE COMBINATION-Use the CHANGING index</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px">To change the combination, you will need the existing combination and LA GARD Group 2M Change Key(P/N 1307). When selecting a combination choose a three number sequence from 0-99. For security purposes LA GARD recommends that you never select a combination from personnal data(birthday,phone number,etc). Never select numbers 0 to 20 as the LAST NUMBER of the combination,this is a forbidden zone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px">(NOTE: if using the Vision Gard Dial [2085 or 2095 Series] the forbidden zone is 97-17.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px">To change the combination, you must first open the safe door by dialing the existing combination on the OPENING index. Before changing combinations, verify that the dial stops between 90 and 0 on the OPENNING index when the lock bolt is fully retracted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px">Caution: when selecting a combination, do not use birthday or other predictable data that could give a correlation between the user and the combination. Keep the combination secret.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px">1.Next dial the existing combination, as previously described, using the CHANGING index. STOP the dial on the third number of the combination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px">2.Insert the Change Key into the key hole. If the Change Key does not go in easily, the wheels are not aligned for changing. Readial the existing combination on the CHANGING index.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px">3.Turn the Change Key to the RIGHT until it stops(approximately one-quarter turn), Leave the key in the lock. Select a new combination, such as 44-6196.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px">4.Still using the CHANGING INDEX, turn the dial to the LEFT and pass 44 three times and stop exactly on 44 the fourth time. Aligning the number with the CHANGING index.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px">7.Hold the dial steady, turn the change key to the LEFT until it stops(approximately one-quarter turn countclockwise) and REMOVE the key.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px">Testing the new combination-dial the combination using the OPENING index, ALWAYS perform this test with the safe door open. Test several times before closing the safe door. Also check that the dial is between 90 and 100 when the bolt is completely retracted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px">Please Note: When locking your safe always turn the safe handle, if present, to its fully locked(bolts extended) position before the dial to turn. Do not turn the safe handle to the locked position with the safe door open as this may damage the safe.</span></p>
